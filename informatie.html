<b>What is machine learning?</b><br>
Machine learning is a method of data analysis and is a branch of Artificial intelligence which mainly focuses on making predictions. This method of data analysis is based on the idea that systems have the capacity to learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with little to no human intervention. Keep in mind that Machine learning is a form of Artificial intelligence, but that AI does not always have to be machine learning!
<br><br>
<b>What is machine learning used for?</b><br>
Machine learning can be used for a lot of different things, the following sectors are using machine learning:
<ol>
  <li>Financial services</li>
  <li>Health care</li>
  <li>Retail</li>
  <li>Oil and gas</li>
  <li>Transportation</li>
  <li>Governments</li>
</ol>
All these sectors are using machine learning to know when their business is making most money and when it is making less. The data analysis system tries to find patterns and reasons to give CEOs and entrepreneurs the opportunity to use this data to make more money.
<br><br>
<b>Example of machine learning</b><br>
One example of machine learning are advertisements. We have all experienced that moment when we see an advertisement for a product we had just looked for on the internet or is very similar to something we bought online already. The reason you see those ads is also due to machine learning. Companies track internet users when they are looking at their favorite webshop or anywhere else online, they collect data. This data is then used for data analysis. Companies do this to have a higher chance of selling their products. For example: Adidas has a partnership with Messi and is trying to sell their brand new “AdidasxMessi” football boots. They want to advertise their product to people who are most likely to buy the new shoes so they use machine learning for data analysis. Person A has just searched for new football boots and watched some videos about Lionel Messi. Person B is a cyclist and searched for a new bike. Using the data collected from both persons A and B, the system is going to decide who should see the advertisement. Obviously person A is going to be targeted with advertisements about the new shoes.
<br><br>
<b>Types of machine learning</b><br>
There are a total of 3 different types of machine learning: Supervised learning, Unsupervised learning and Reinforcement learning.
<br><br>
Supervised learning is the most basic type of learning out of these three. The machine learns through labeled data, which is often a piece of a larger part of data. The machine is task-driven. This way the machine gets an idea of the problem and is able to piece all the information together to find a relationship between the input and the output. With this type of learning the machine will continue to improve itself and learn more from the data.
<br><br>
Unsupervised learning has a major advantage over supervised learning as the data does not have to be labeled. This means that no human labor is required for this type of machine learning. Due to the fact that there are no labels, the system can perceive relationships between data points in an abstract manner.
<br><br>
Reinforcement learning takes direct inspiration from the way human beings learn in their daily lives. The algorithm uses a trial-and-error method and works with favorable and non-favorable outcomes. The system encourages favorable outcomes (reinforced) and discourages non-favorable outcomes (punished).This type of learning works with an interpreter which rewards or punishes the system depending on the outcome. This rewards system is directly connected with the effectiveness of this kind of learning.
